# ðŸ’¼ AI-ML Based Fraud Detection in Banking Systems

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project implements a **client-side fraud detection system** based on AI-ML models for banking applications. It fuses behavioural biometrics, transactional graph patterns, and threat intelligence to dynamically assess risk and prevent fraud in real-time.

## ðŸ§  Models Implemented

### âœ… Model 1: Behaviour Analysis
- **Static Encoder** â€“ Encodes individual actions like touch, tap duration, typing.
- **Sequential LSTM** â€“ Captures behavioural flow over time.
- **Fusion Layer** â€“ Combines static and temporal vectors to output a fraud probability score.

### âœ… Model 2: Transaction Pattern GNN
- Graph Neural Network built on transaction relationships.
- Nodes = accounts, merchants, ATMs; Edges = transactions.
- Detects anomalies in transaction structure and timing.

### âœ… Model 3: Threat Intelligence
- **XGBoost** for known fraud patterns (supervised).
- **Isolation Forest** for novel frauds (unsupervised).
- **Rule Engine** flags mismatches (IP, device count).
- Final output passed through a DNN classifier.
